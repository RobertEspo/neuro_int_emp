# Introduction




# Scraps

Are declaratives and interrogatives processed differently in the brain? When declaratives and information-seeking absolute interrogatives are differentiated only by intonation, what ERP responses correlate with the two modalities?

Empathy correlates with more attention to intonation. Are there ERP diffs between high vs low empathy individuals when processing intonation?
L2 Spanish learners with higher empathy are more accurate at identifying a declarative vs an absolute interrogative based on intonation alone -- can this be reflected in ERP responses? (Casillas).
L1 French speakers with higher empathy make greater use of intonation to disambiguate words in on-line processing (D'Imperio, eye-tracking).
L1 Italian speakers with higher intonation and more experience with other varieties have more gradient perception of intonation (Orrico).
